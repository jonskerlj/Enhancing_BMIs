# Enhancing_BMIs

Brain-Machine Interface (BMI) code for the Final Year Master's Project at Imperial College London

## Main project tasks:
- Recreate already existing decoders and record their performance for two different motor tasks: center-out (CO) and sequential reaching (SR) task
- Investgating the affects of additional premotor cortex (PMd) neural data for both tasks
- Analysing ensemble decoders that combine classification with regression


#### External libraries:
Preprocessing of neural data is done with **PyalData library**. For more information visit: https://github.com/mattperich/PyalData.

Building and testing different decoders is done in **Neural Decoding library** environment. Additional details can be found: https://github.com/kordinglab/neural_decoding.
